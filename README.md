# Project 5: Around The U.S.

This project is the fifth in Practicum's Software Engineering course. It is the third stage of a previous project. This project makes use of JavaScript to show a pop-up window to allow users to edit their profile name and their profile title. In addition, the user can now add a place and image URL to add a new card to the gallery, and images on the cards can now be inspected when clicked. Using the `<template>` element and with the help of JavaScript, the page dynamically creates the cards and adds them to the container.

## Project Features

- Semantic HTML
- CSS grid
- CSS media queries
- Responsive web design
- JavaScript

## Future Plans

I hope to add more functionality to the site over the next stages of the course including allowing users to sign up for profiles and interact with other profiles.
