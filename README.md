# Project 6: Around The U.S.

This project is the sixth in Practicum's Software Engineering course. It is the fourth stage of a previous project. This project introduces form validation. Using JavaScript, the `validityState` object, `input` event listeners, as well as several functions, the information is automatically validated as a user inputs information in the forms. If the input does not pass validation, the form displays an error message in real time and styles the form's input to show errors. Other features added are the ability to close the popup windows by clicking outside of the popup windows. The popup windows can also be closed by pressing the escape key.

## Project Features

- Semantic HTML
- CSS grid
- CSS media queries
- Responsive web design
- JavaScript

## Future Plans

I hope to add more functionality to the site over the next stages of the course including allowing users to sign up for profiles and interact with other profiles.
