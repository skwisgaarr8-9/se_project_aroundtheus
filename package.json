  "description": "This project is the seventh in Practicum's Software Engineering course. It is the fifth stage of a previous project. This project was all about refractoring. In this sprint, we learned about JavaScript classes, Object Oriented Programming and the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. In this project, I reorganized my code to create two classes `Card` and `FormValidator`. `Card` holds all of the functionality for creating the cards of the picture gallery. `FormValidator` holds all of the functionality of validating the user's input.",
